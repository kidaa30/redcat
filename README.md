# Surikat - Full Stack Web Framework

Power to Extend the Web
-------

 Surikat is designed to enhance developer abilities and bring project's quality to excellence. Surikat is a full stack framework, a group of decoupled components workings together to make a complete web developement solution. If you're aware of [OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) and you like [PHP](http://php.et), the most popular language for web developement, Surikat can help you to boost your workflow and increase your productivity.

What's a framework ?
--------------------

 Most of times, developpers write a lot of boiler plate source code. One of the framework purposes is to avoid all this unecessary work. But many of the populars frameworks don't really resolve this problem and even sometimes, so as to build an open and flexible architecture, replace common code by a lot of supplementary work to use the components it provides. Consequently, many developers no longer see the benefit to use a framework, and then it is unfortunate to note that, start with a framework, is not anymore the most common way to work on web applications. With a good framework the code is easy to re-use and web applications are easy to design.

Why another framework ?
-----------------------

 I did'nt want to choose between scalability, based on good-practices, and rapid deployment, based on pragmatism. The one based on full configuration, flexible but tedious, and the other based on strict conventions, efficient but arbitrary limited. All frameworks i've seen can be classed in these two categories.   
 However it's possible to reach the simplicity of [RAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development) but without sacrifice of programming scalability and [agility](http://agilemanifesto.org) respecting [SOLID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_%28object-oriented_design%29) principles and best practices. With implicit powerfull conventions but overriding configuration Surikat bring the right approach.

Let's work together !
---------------------

 The Surikat architecture is [loosely coupled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling) and respect the [SoC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) principles. That's mean each component is independent from the others and you can use them without the whole Surikat Framework. You can use them separately into any other [web application framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_framework), [CMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system), [groupware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_software), [CRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management) or custom application.

 But you can also work with somes other popular frameworks like [Zend](https://github.com/zendframework), [Symfony](https://symfony.com), [PEAR](https://pear.php.net), [Aura](http://auraphp.com) or many others inside Surikat very easily. Surikat have somes exclusive features and killer components, but did'nt reinvent the wheel unnecessarily and some others frameworks has nice components you can use for specifics needs. Moreover, some of majors Surikat's components are mainly inspired by others tools from the community of PHP developers.

 For sum up, Surikat can be used as wrapper, to work on top of your application, as well as a library of awesome components.

The Developement Theorem
------------------------

 Surikat paradigm: See Away, Be Light, Run Fast - like the [Meerkat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meerkat) behavior

### See Away
-	Scalabilty (durability)
-	Reusability
-	Reliability

### Be Light
-	Maintainability
-	Accuracy (consistency)
-	Lightness ([DRY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself))

### Run Fast
-	Performance
-	Lightweight (memory size)
-	Speed (execution time)

 
 In coding we often have to find balance between these objectives and sometimes we have to take care of one to the detriment of others. But more often the one side can improve the others and we just didn't find the good way to conciliate all.   
 In each phase of developement, Surikat was designed with this theory in mind and respect, in all of his components, as much as suitable, all these qualities that make a good source code.

Progressive Structuring
-----------------------

 Surikat is based on innovative approach that will satisfy as well the highly structured than the wild developers.  
 Whether you prefer scientist and well formed Router and Modular [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) Design Patterns, or rather the simplicity of working artistically with a template engine as a complete solution, you'll can do both and also structuring progressively as is increasing the complexity of your application. Both approach can coexist at differents levels of implementation without the need to prevent incompatibility unlike in traditionnal frameworks.  
 Packed with robust and ready to use conventions, it will allow you to deploy unlimited evolutions according to the potential of your imagination. Feel free to be creative with trust and serenity.

About
-----

 Surikat-Framework is designed by the [BDFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life) [Jo](http://surikat.pro) ([jo@surikat.pro](mailto:%6a%6f@%73%75%72%69%6b%61%74.%70%72%6f)). Surikat come from many years of personal studies and developement but it need your support to build an open source community around and improve its solidity by [reporting issues and bugs](https://github.com/surikat/surikat/issues), bring suggestions and [sharing it](About).

Surikat-Framework, designed with madness and love by a [web developer](http://jo-developer.ninja) for web developers !
